# SteelPricePrediction
Objective: Developed a predictive model using historical data to forecast future steel prices, aiding in production planning, inventory management, and financial decision-making.

Techniques Used: Employed various Machine Learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest, K Neighbors, and XGBoost.

Data Handling: Preprocessed and cleaned a dataset of historical steel prices, performed feature engineering, and used normalization techniques.

Model Performance: Achieved high predictive accuracy with ensemble methods (Random Forest and XGBoost) outperforming simpler models, validated using cross-validation and performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, RÂ²).

Tools and Libraries: Utilized Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and XGBoost for data analysis and model implementation.
